Hello guys, I am here with my 1st ever article for all of you.
First of all let me introduce myself, I am sujit kumar mishra a simple guy like all of you ,still studying in college. I think this is enough now lets start our todya's topic  "our  education system"
ok so here i am sharing my thoughts on our own education system . Before Starting i clearly mentioned that  it's my own thoughts nothing else so u may agree or not to it . 

### The dream of APJ Abdul Kalam isn’t came true till today because of our government and society(all of us including me and you.)
To know more about how bad is our education system lets know-how our education system was made…

In the mid 18th century, British East India Company wanted to establish industries in India. To run those industries, they needed three types of employees
- Clerks: To do office works.
- Military Man: To secure industries and the British empire.
- Workers: To work in industries.

To do these jobs, a person don’t need to be creative. So, Britisher build an education system to teach Indian. Sadly that education system is still followed in India and that is why students can’t become the best version of themselves.

## Why our education system is bad?
There are plenty of reasons why our education system is bad, but here are some of them:
- It produces parrots: Our education system teaches us to just consume more and more information. Which don’t make us next Einstein but it leads to stress and forgetfulness in our life.
- Lack of knowledge: According to ASER, 62.8% students of 6th grades can’t even read.
- It only cares about marks: Our education system just wants marks. It doesn’t care about what are you interested in or which subject do you love.
- Pressure of our society: From the point above, if someone tries to follow his heart and do what he loves to do, then the society humiliate him so bad that he can’t never think of doing what he loved to do.
- Syllabus is rusted: Our government doesn’t keep our syllabus up to date. There are less productive chapters and courses in our syllabus.
- Worst Gift: Do you know what’s the worst thing that our education system gives us? It is a fear mindset. Remember when were in schools and you got bad grades, your parents and teachers bullied you so bad that you now have a fear mindset. Now you think that doing a mistake is a bad thing, but in order to learn something new you have to do some mistakes and because of that fear mindset that you have, you don’t dare to do any mistakes and you end up learning nothing.

### There are a ton more bad side, but let’s take a look at the good side of our education system

# How Our Education System Is Good?
- Less expensive: Yeah! The cost of education in India is less expensive as compared to other countries like the USA and UK, but the value that our education system provides us, is it worth it?
After completing expensive courses like BCA, BBA, etc. The only thing we get is a piece of paper popularly known as ‘Degree’
- Produces the highest number of Engineers: Do you know which country produces the highest number of engineers around the globe?
 Yes, you guessed it right, it is India. But here is a shocking report by Indiatoday.
 India produces 1.5 million engineers every year and 97% of graduating engineers want jobs either in software engineering or core engineering.

  However, only 3% have suitable skills to be employed in software or product market, and only 7% can handle core engineering tasks.
That’s how our education system serves our nation. I’m not saying that every school and college are the same, there are some colleges and schools, which educate the students very well.
Now you know, how bad our education system is…

# How can we improve/secure the future of our country?

When I was a kid, my solution to this question was “Government should completely change this education system ”, but as I grew up I understand that this solution was totally impractical.

 But there are plenty of solutions that can secure our country’s future. These solutions can’t change the education system completely.

 ## Solution 1(The Government way) :- 
  Government should deploy better teachers, teachers who understand the psychology of children, teachers who are enthusiastic about teaching kids, teachers who are very creative at teaching kids.
 Government should also modify the syllabus and should add those concepts in syllabus that are interesting to children, concepts that encourage kids to know more about it.
 The government should invest more money in the education of kids, who are future of the nation.

 ## Solution 2(The Student way) :- 
  You should change the mentality, which you have, you should think of becoming an employer, not an employee. You should think of becoming innovators, artists, scientists, thinkers and writers who can establish the foundation of a knowledge-based economy rather than the low-quality service provider nation that we are turning into.
You should find your passions, what you love to do and choose it as a career option without thinking of the criticism of society.
If you choose your passion as your career, then even if your college is bad, you will excel because of your curiosity about the subject and thanks to the internet, with the internet you can learn almost anything without even money.

 
# Conclusion
 Don’t you think that famous personalities like Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, APJ Abdul Kalam, Aamir Khan, Dhirubhai Ambani, Sachin Tendulkar and many more like them had studied by this bad education system?
 
 ## Yes, our education system is bad, but if you love what you study you will learn more and more about your subject with the help of Internet.
